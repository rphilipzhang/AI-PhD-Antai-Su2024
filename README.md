## About
Welcome to the mono-repo of the PhD course AI for Business Research at SJTU Antai College of Economics and Management in Summer 2024. You may download the [Syllabus](https://github.com/rphilipzhang/AI-PhD-Antai-Su2024/blob/main/AI-PhD-Syllabus-Su2024.pdf) of this course first. The purpose of this course is to learn the following:

- Have a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts/methods in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that are used (or potentially useful) in business research.
- Understand how business researchers have utilized ML/AI and what managerial questions have been addressed by ML/AI in the recent decade.
- Nurture a taste of what the state-of-the-art AI/ML technologies can do in the ML/AI community and, potentially, in your own research field.

We will meet at the time specified above in XXX. Please ask for my approval if you need to join us via the following Tencent Meeting link:

- [Tencent Meeting link](), Meeting ID XXX, Passcode XXX. 

Most of the code in this course will be distributed through the [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) cloud computing environment to avoid the incompatibility and version control issues on your local individual computer. On the other hand, you can always download the Jupyter Notebook from CoLab and run it your own computer.

- The **CoLab** files of this course can be found at [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CF1Xu4oJXFFNhjSoMNVZGbhNjT3wdAq9?usp=sharing).
- The **Google Sheet** to sign up for groups and group tasks can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/127rkG4QN_85JNQce9g3egzby9c72Yk0kRZqfUE7QfYA/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have any feedback on this course, please directly contact Philip at philipzhang@cuhk.edu.hk and we will try our best to address it.
